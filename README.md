# Programming Language with LLVM

This is a repository for the [Programming Language with LLVM](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/courses/programming-language-with-llvm/) course.

As mentioned in the class description, we want our students to understand and implement every piece of detail from the VM themselves, instead of copy-pasting from the final solution.

Therefore, the source code here provides only the overall structure of the project, leaving the missing parts as assignments. The _"Implement here..."_ comments with references to appropriate video lectures, show specific places which are needed to be completed in order to finalize the full working interpreter.

Example:

```cpp
if (op == "var") {
  // Implement here: see Lecture 14
}
```
